Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: when number of simulations increased all time belgium won and its becuase of convergency of model that made it same in any repeats after 10000 times.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after 10000 simulations model will get convergent.y
